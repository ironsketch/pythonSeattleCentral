'''The speeding ticket fine policy in Podunksville is $50 plus $5 for
each mph over the limit plus a penalty of $200 for any speed over 90
mph. Write a program that accepts a speed limit and a clocked speed
and either prints a message indicating the speed was legal or prints
the amount of the fine, if the speed is illegal.'''
